Inhibitor is a python module that provides support for building Gentoo Linux
OS releases.  It is designed to make generic stage4 builds as easy as possible
while still supporting a high level of customization.  Inhibitor can be
compared to other Gentoo release tools such as Catalyst or Metro.  However,
Inhibitor focuses strictly on providing common functionality required to create
an OS release and not on being the full-featured release tool itself.

Configuring a build using Inhibitor is done in by creating a python script that
imports Inhibitor.  This serves two purposes, it allows the configuration to be
separate from the build system and allows full use of python in the
configuration yielding the possibility that one configuration may actually
support many different builds.

See the examples directory for a basic stage4 and usb rescue build.
